The diameter of a tree (sometimes called the width) is the number of nodes on the longest
path between two end nodes. The diagram below shows two trees each with diameter nine, the
leaves that form the ends of the longest path are shaded (note that there is more than one 
path in each tree of length nine, but no path longer than nine nodes).

class Solution {
                                            // Function to return the diameter of a Binary Tree.
    
    int  dia=0;

     public  int  findhight(Node root){
          if(root==null) return 0;

         int lh=findhight(root.left);
         int rh=findhight(root.right);

         dia=Math.max(dia,lh+rh);                       //we can also write here(lh+rh+1) insted of +1 in return(dia+1)
                                                //extar line than max hight which help us to calculate diameter

         return 1+Math.max(lh,rh);

     }
     
     //START---->
    int diameter(Node root) {
     
         findhight(root);
         
         return dia+1;                             //we add 1 because in gfg the count node in there hight but in leetcode the consider edge
    }
    
     
}

/*Approch:- O(n) 
we follow the idea of max hight code
1.we find maximum height at every node 
2. on other side i compare sum of (left max height and right max hight )at each node and find maximum sum 
which is our actual diameter*/
